# Disable Quiet Mode

Removes the `.quiet` file from `~/.claude/hooks/` to re-enable all TTS announcements across all Claude Code sessions.

When quiet mode is disabled:
- Completion announcements will be spoken again
- Notification sounds will play
- All TTS functionality is restored

Use `/quiet` to disable TTS announcements.

I'll disable quiet mode by removing the quiet flag file.
